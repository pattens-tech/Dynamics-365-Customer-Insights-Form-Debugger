## How to Use

1. Install the extension from the Edge Add-ons or Chrome Web Store.
2. Open a Dynamics 365 form page, such as: `https://assets-*.mkt.dynamics.com/...`
3. Click the **Dynamics 365 Form Debugger** icon in your browser toolbar.

## Privacy & Data

This extension **does not** collect, transmit, or store any user or form data.
All functionality (cache toggle, form detection, and form checks) is performed entirely on your device.

**Permissions Used:**
- `storage` - To save your extension on/off preference locally
- `activeTab` - To read form information from the current active tab
- `<all_urls>` - Required because Dynamics 365 forms can be embedded on any website, not just Microsoft domains. The extension only activates when it detects a Dynamics 365 form on the page.
